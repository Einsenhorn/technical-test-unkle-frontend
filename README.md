## Node.Js

For both tests you'll need Node.Js on your computer. Right now, I'm using the version mentioned in the `.nvmrc` file at the root of this repository; if you have the same that's perfect, if not you could use a tool like [https://github.com/jasongin/nvs](nvs) to help you with that (should work on both Windows & Mac if I'm not miscorrect).

```
nvs use auto
```

This command will select the same version I'm using (he might ask you to install it).
Also, if you're version of Node.Js is close to the one I used for this test you should be good to go and could skip that.

### How To Run It Locally

#### Dependencies
A simple `npm install` should do the trick here; as we are using a package-lock, you'll be able to install the same dependencies I used for this test.

#### Commands

You can simply run a `npm run storybook` and play with it.
